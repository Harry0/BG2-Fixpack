@137 = ~BERSERKER: Berserkers are warriors in tune with their animalistic side and, during combat, can achieve an ecstatic state of mind that will enable them to fight longer, harder and more savagely than any humanoid has a right to. Berserkers tend to be barbarian-like in nature, but not always. Sometimes it is a conscious choice that a warrior in training makes. Regardless, opponents on the battlefield will be unsettled when they see the savage elements of the berserker's personality. This class is common amongst dwarves, known to them as 'battleragers'.

-  Cannot specialize (two proficiency points) in ranged weapons (bows, crossbows, slings, or darts)~ []
@138 = ~BARBARIAN: A barbarian can be an excellent warrior. While not as disciplined or as skilled as a normal fighter, the barbarian can willingly be thrown into a berserker rage, becoming a tougher and stronger opponent.

Advantages:
-  Moves at 2 points faster than the normal character movement rate
-  Immunity to backstab
-  Can Rage once per day per every 4 levels (starts at 1st level with one use). Rage gives +4 to constitution and strength for 5 rounds. Gives a 2 point armor class penalty and +2 to saves vs magic (for 5 rounds). Rage also gives immunity to all charm, hold, fear, maze, confusion, stun, sleep and level drain spells.
-  At 11th level the barbarian gains 10% resistance to slashing, piercing, crushing and missile damage, and gains a further +5% to this at levels 15 and 19.
-  The barbarian rolls D12 for hit points instead of a fighter's D10.

Disadvantages:
-  Cannot wear full plate or plate mail armors.
-  Cannot specialize in weapons past normal specialization (two proficiency points.)~ []

This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the minor globe. Fourth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by forms of magical attack such as Spellstrike and Pierce Magic.~

With this spell, the wizard may create a random teleportation effect as far as the wizard can see. All enemies caught in the area of effect are randomly teleported for the duration of the spell. This spell is best used against multiple enemies, serving to confuse them, and allowing the wizard to concentrate on activating his or her defenses.~ []

@159 = ~Find Familiar
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 1
Range: n/a
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 familiar
Saving Throw: Special

This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as his aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with him, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, and he has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all.
(Note: This spell may only be cast by the protagonist.)

The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. 

The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. 

The caster receives half the familiar's total hit points as bonus hit points. However the caster must take care to treat his familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the caster loses the bonus hit points and half the familiar's hit points again as damage. Also when a familiar dies, the caster loses 1 point of constitution PERMANENTLY.

Example: A mage has 12 hit points and casts find familiar. The imp summoned has 18 hit points, so the caster gets a bonus of 9 hit points. The caster now has 21 hit points. If the familiar dies the caster loses those 9 hit points (putting him back at 12), 1 point of constitution permanently (which may cause additional hit point loss), and takes 9 damage.

This massive bow was the property of the ranger Bearpaw, who reportedly received it from a strangely benevolent ogre.

Bearpaw could draw back the bow without the slightest effort, but when he died it was bequeathed to his wife and sons, and not a one could draw the string even halfway.  They eventually sold it to a merchant heading South.

The Dragonslayers met their match in a cantankerous ancient red who slew the entire group in an epic battle.  This weapon did not end up in the beast's hoard however, as the creature returned to its lair to recuperate and when it emerged the field of combat was well scavenged.

At the coming of spring Cernd examined it one last time, and it came loose in his hands, a living staff, granted as boon from nature herself.  It has grown to fit his grip, and few others may wield it.

Bala was a foul-tempered prince of a gully dwarf clan, which was enslaved by a cruel elven mage in Thesk. Though Bala managed to escape the more cowardly traits of his race he was even more filthy and obnoxious than the average gully dwarf. Sickened of his enslavement, Bala crept into the mage's lair and cracked the elf's skull open. Although rumor has it that it was the dwarf's stench that overcame the mage, it was, in fact, his enchanted axe that dispelled the elf's magical defenses. It is obvious from the poor workmanship that Bala himself crafted the axe. The mystery lies in where its power originates. After a lengthy career of mage-slaying, Bala died, never having revealed his secret to those who were willing to risk a lice infestation by approaching him. Some say that the axe was powered by Bala's intense hatred of wizards. The axe gives the owner the ability to dispel magic once a day.
